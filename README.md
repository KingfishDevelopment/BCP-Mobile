BCP Mobile
==========

BCP Mobile is an iOS app designed to help Bellarmine students access their grades, calendar, announcements, and more.

Since being released as a small side project in the fall of 2012, BCP Mobile has been used by over 1,800 students (we think that's pretty nifty for a school of 1,600!), and with the introduction of iPads to Bellarmine, having a way for students to access the abundance of information they need from their mobile devices is more important than ever.

That's why now is the time for the transition from small side project to fully-featured application. And nothing says "fully-featured application" (or "Bellarmine", for that matter) quite like a project that the whole school community can work on. That's why the new, rebuilt-from-scratch BCP Mobile is open-source, and why every student is encouraged to take a look at the project and put their talents to work, whether that's designing graphics, writing descriptions, or simply doing some good-old-fashioned coding.

Get started now, or keep reading for more information on the techincal side of BCP Mobile.

About
-----

The version of BCP Mobile released here is currently in development, but as of commit [4fcf7fc3c9](https://github.com/KingfishDevelopment/BCP-Mobile/commit/4fcf7fc3c95e8cbe1fbe2cb33c2c91c2d2cce2f0), it features a fully functioning grades and login system. More functionality will continue to be added, but as long as you're working with that commit or newer, the app will function for checking grades at some basic level.

More detail than this will be provided as the app makes progress, of course.

Contributing
------------

If you're not quite familiar with how to contribute to a git project, GitHub has a [great tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) (along with many others you may find useful). If you've got that down, feel free to get started- simply submit a pull request and it will be reviewed and, hopefully, approved!

Thanks

Thank you to everyone who contributes here, to everyone who is helping to test the app, and to everyone who uses the app in general.
But in particular, a huge thank you to the original authors and many contributors of [SBJson](https://github.com/stig/json-framework/) and [SVPullToRefresh](https://github.com/samvermette/SVPullToRefresh), two open-source frameworks that help make BCP-Mobile work. Frameworks like these are what make open-source so awesome.
