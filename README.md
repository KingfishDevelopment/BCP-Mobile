About
-----

This open-source version of BCP Mobile is designed to replace the moderately outdated version currently available to students. The particular version shown here is a full revision of the current progress on the update, designed to help clean up code and incorporate new practices. Once the revision is caught up, the two will be merged together, and then more technical details will be available in this section.

Contributing
------------

If you're not quite familiar with how to contribute to a git project, GitHub has a [great tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) (along with many others you may find useful). If you've got that down, feel free to get started- simply submit a pull request and it will be reviewed and, hopefully, approved!

Thanks

Thank you to everyone who contributes here, to everyone who is helping to test the app, and to everyone who uses the app in general.
But in particular, a huge thank you to the original authors and many contributors of [FlatUIKit](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit), [SBJson](https://github.com/stig/json-framework/), and [SVPullToRefresh](https://github.com/samvermette/SVPullToRefresh), three open-source frameworks that help make BCP-Mobile work. Frameworks like these are what make open-source so awesome.
